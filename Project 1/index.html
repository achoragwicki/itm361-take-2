      <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>My name is Andrew. I am from the southwest suburbs. I am a second year ITM major. I'm interested in specializing in system administration.
        I currently intern at my local recreation center as an IT technician. I hope to expand my experience and try to go further into either cyber security
      or software development. From my first computer (1998 Compq) to my current Asus device, computers and everything about them have always
       facinated me. My passion is motorcycles. I enjoy riding as well as fixing motorcycles. I have been riding since I could walk. I started on
     dirtbikes and started moving to street bikes.   </p>
